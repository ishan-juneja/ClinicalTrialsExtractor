"Inclusion Criteria:

* Diagnosis of AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria
* Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 16-26. This range corresponds roughly to ""mild"" AD as rated by CDR below, and provides a rapid test for efficient screening of potential participants.
* Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) \< 1 (mild dementia). This corresponds with ""early"" AD. Participants will be eligible if they have AD diagnosis and CDR of 0.5 or 1.0. The category of CDR 0.5 AD is particularly important to include as these participants are in the earliest stage that can be diagnosed as dementia (as opposed to mild cognitive impairment) and thus are in the ""earliest"" clinical stage of AD.
* Patients will be allowed to remain on current FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments including cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, so long as the dose has been stable for \>= 3 months. These medications lack any notable effects on amyloid synthesis or metabolism and thus there is no reason to exclude them. The rationale behind requiring a stable dose is so that change in the trial can be attributed to the study intervention rather than recent changes of other medications affecting cognition.
* Patients will be allowed to remain on antidepressant and antipsychotics medications so long as the dose has been stable for \>= 3 months. The rationale is the same as above.
* Knowledgeable informant available for all study visits. This is standard practice in AD research because many standard instruments and questionnaires in this trial require a knowledgeable informant.

Exclusion criteria

* Evidence of non-AD dementias including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, or frontotemporal dementia.

  2.Current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Diploma in Social Medicine (DSM)-IV Axis I diagnoses other than dementia, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse, or other substance abuse.

* Any clinically significant medical condition that could interfere with the subject's ability to safely participate in the study or to be followed.
* Current use of Beta-blocking agents.
* Contraindications to use of Beta-blocking agents, to be determined in consultation with the patient's primary care physician or (if appropriate) cardiologist.

"Inclusion Criteria:

This study will recruit patients diagnosed with focal hyperhidrosis with a known diagnosis of primarily axillary localization.

We will only enroll patients available for both treatment visits. Availability for follow-up visit is optional.

Only patients between the ages of 18 and 29 years when the first HHIQ is administered will be eligible.

The upper age limit was so determined because patients over 29 years often present with psychopathology which is far more recalcitrant to correction of any kind regardless of effectiveness because of the duration of the condition.

The lower age limit was so determined because 18 years and up are the ages for which the miraDry ® procedure has been approved for use by the FDA.

All participants will be screened using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS).

Only patients reporting their condition as a 3 out of 4 or higher on the HDSS will be eligible for study because preliminary data suggests effective detection of psychological changes only at higher reported levels of sweating severity.

A patient's previous non-invasive treatment course, including but not limited to prescription of psychiatric medication and topical therapies, will not justify exclusion from this study.

"Inclusion Criteria

Men and women at the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit(ACTU) will be eligible to participate if they meet four criteria: (a) 18 years of age and older; and (b) diagnosis of HIV; and (c) self-reported smoking on a daily basis; and (d) provide informed written consent.

Exclusion criteria

Persons who meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: (a) persons with active psychosis or impaired mental status as judged by the clinic staff and confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam); (b) unable to understand spoken English; (c) age less than 18 years.

Rationale: Persons with cognitive impairment may participate in the study if they are able to provide consent and answer questionnaire questions. No reason is identified to exclude persons with this characteristic. No special risks are posed to cognitively impaired persons who are able to provide consent. Persons who have active psychoses or impaired mental status as judged by the clinic staff and confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam are not able to provide informed written consent and are unlikely to benefit from the treatment. These persons will be referred to appropriate mental health services and invited to participate when their mental status has improved.

Persons who are unable to understand spoken English would not be able to complete the assessments or benefit from the treatments. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be excluded on this basis. However, persons excluded from the study on this basis will be referred for standard smoking cessation treatment delivered in their native tongue. These community resources may be identified through the Ohio State University Nursing Center for Tobacco Intervention.

Younger adolescents (\<18 years) will not be invited to participate in the study because we believe that they require treatments that are qualitatively different from those designed for older adolescents and adults. The treatments that will be evaluated in the proposed research are well suited to older adolescents and adults, but not developmentally tailored to younger adolescents. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be excluded on this basis. Most HIV+ children living in Columbus, Ohio receive HIV medical care through the F.A.C.E.S. outpatient clinic at Columbus Children's Hospital. Standard, age appropriate, smoking cessation treatment is available through the Health and Wellness Center at Columbus Children's Hospital. In the unlikely circumstance that a child \<18 years of age wishes to participate in the proposed study, s/he will be referred to Health and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital for treatment or the Ohio State University Nursing Center for Tobacco Intervention for age appropriate smoking cessation community resources.

Pregnant women may not be included as subjects. While smoking during pregnancy is an important modifiable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes, little information is available on the safety or efficacy of varenicline. Therefore, participants who are pregnant will be excluded as subjects. Also, women who are breast-feeding will be excluded.

Other persons who are unable to use varenicline will be allowed to participate in the study but will not receive the varenicline component of treatment. A history and physical examination will be conducted as a component of the baseline evaluation.

"Inclusion Criteria:

Diagnosis of aMCI: in general, the diagnosis of aMCI follows the definition in the 2011 National Institute on Aging (NIA)/ Alzheimer's association (AA) guidelines, without biomarkers. Participants must have:

* Subjective memory concerns reported by participant, study partner, or clinician.
* A mini-mental state exam between ≥ 22 for subjects with more than 8 years of education. For subjects with less than 8 years of education, a MMSE ≥ 20 will be allowed.
* Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. The memory box score must be at least 0.5. Information from the formal University of Washington CDR instrument, report by the participant of subjective cognitive complaints, and findings from the screening neuropsychological battery, can be used for this determination by the investigative team. For example, the University of Washington CDR can be 0, but the CDR memory box score can be deemed to be 0.5 based on cognitive complaints at screening and meeting the MCI neuropsychological criteria.
* General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease cannot be made by the site physician at the time of the screening visit.
* Abnormal memory function documented by scoring within the education adjusted ranges on the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised.

  * For early MCI:

    * 9-11 for 16 or more years of education
    * 5-9 for 8-15 years of education
    * 3-6 for 0-7 years of education
  * For late MCI

    * ≤ 8 for 16 or more years of education
    * ≤ 4 for 8-15 years of education
    * ≤ 2 for 0-7 years of education
* Age range: 55 years to 90 years.
* Sex distribution: all eligible men and women will be included and no one will be excluded because of gender.
* Languages: fluent in English or Spanish. We have reliable, well-validated Spanish tests for all outcome measures.
* Participants without a known history of diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed during screening (hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 % or greater) they will also be excluded. The main justification for this exclusion is the potential for these participants to be placed on other diabetes medications that may confound our study.
* General cognition and functional performance such that a diagnosis of dementia cannot be made at the time of screening based on DSM-V criteria.
* Vision and hearing must be sufficient for compliance with testing procedures.
* Must have an informant to come to all appointments or be available by telephone at follow-up visits.

Study Partner Inclusion Criteria

* The study partner can provide an independent evaluation of functioning for a person enrolled in the MAP study as a participant
* The study partner agrees to attend study visits with the MAP participant or be available by telephone.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Use of metformin or any class of medication approved for treatment of diabetes, even if it is used for an indication other than diabetes (e.g., obesity), within one year of screening. These medications include GLP-1 agonists used for weight loss.
* Body mass index ≤ 20 k/m2.
* Metformin is contraindicated in persons with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min. For persons with an eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min, a reduction of the dose or discontinuation of the medication is recommended for those on metformin; in this range, it is also recommended that persons do not initiate metformin. Thus, participants with eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min will not be eligible to participate.
* The risk of lactic acidosis is increased in persons with liver disease and class III or IV congestive heart failure. Thus, persons with liver disease other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or class III or IV congestive heart failure will not be eligible to participate due to the risks of side effects.
* A history of intolerance to metformin.
* History of cerebrovascular accident with residual neurological deficits.
* Moderate to severe depression, indicated by a score in the Geriatric Depression Scale of 9/15 or higher.
* Dementia diagnosis
* Lack of capacity to consent
* Participants with neurologic diseases associated with neurologic deficits on clinical examination.
* Participants with other current Axis I psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.
* Alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past 6 months.
* Use of medications rated as being the likely cause of cognitive impairment. These include benzodiazepines in dose equivalents greater than 2 mg daily of lorazepam, and regular use of prescription narcotics.
* Normal individuals without cognitive complaints.
* Participants with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 mmHg).
* Participants with active cancer or a history of cancer within the last two years, with the exception of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
* Participants who for any reason may not complete the study as judged by the study physician.
* Participants planning to move to another city or state during the duration of the study.
* Participants with a known history of diabetes. The rationale for this exclusion is persons with diabetes may already be on metformin or on other medications that increase insulin levels and could confound the trial.
* Participants with diabetes discovered on screening based on American Diabetes Association criteria using HbA1c (HbA1c of 6.5% or greater). Although metformin could be a first treatment of diabetes for these participants, addition of treatments for diabetes by physicians could confound the study.
* Use of any other amyloid modifying treatment for AD such as lecanemab, either experimental or approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is exclusionary. Previous use of amyloid targeting therapy that was shown to be non-efficacious (e.g., solunazemab) is not exclusionary.
* Not able to undergo phlebotomy as reported by the participant or determined by the study coordinator or physician.
* Participants with known, suspected, or plan for becoming pregnant.
* The presence of a medical condition, and/or use of a medication and/or any substance, individually or in aggregate, that in the judgement of the study team, is the primary cause of cognitive impairment. For example, if hypothyroidism, cobalamin deficiency, or tertiary syphilis are reported or found during screening, they could be deemed as being likely contributors to cognitive impairment, and thus be exclusionary. Combinations of multiple medications with anti-cholinergic effects with or without other central nervous system depressants could also be considered as being causative of cognitive impairment and exclusionary.

"The eligibility criteria of volunteers, persons with AD/ADRD, and their caregivers is deliberately lax in order to best reflect LSS-MN ""routine practice."" Participants must be either a volunteer, client, or proxy involved in the LSS-MN standard Caregiver \& Companion Program service program. Programmatic and survey data on the volunteers, clients, and proxies involved will be shared with the UMN team. While all data received may be analyzed (see analysis section below), data analysis is expected to focus on those who meet the following additional criteria:

* Volunteers who are listed in the LSS database.
* Clients with cognitive concerns (i.e. minor confusion, memory loss, diagnosis for their memory loss, or concerns about cognition) via the LSS-MN surveys and/or the LSS-MN CRM database.
* Caregivers whose care recipient receives volunteer respite, and either the caregiver indicates their care recipient has memory loss or the care recipient has cognitive concerns (i.e. minor confusion, memory loss, diagnosis for their memory loss, or concerns about cognition) via the LSS-MN surveys and/or the LSS-MN CRM database.

Note: When discrepancies in reported memory loss between caregivers and clients occur, data from both the caregiver and client will be included and it will be assumed that the client has memory loss. Due to the nature of the data, we expect discrepancies to exist and will document other decisions made during analysis.

Exclusion Criteria:

As data is made available, the UMN research team expects to receive survey data from all the clients, caregivers, and volunteers in LSS-MN Caregiver \& Companion Services programming who complete the surveys, and those included in the LSS database. Since LSS-MN administers surveys to every client, caregiver, and volunteer involved in their LSS-MN Caregiver \& Companion program (as able), data likely will be obtained from individuals who do not meet the memory-specific criteria. However, as needed, UMN may choose to exclude one or more of the following from analysis. Again, the researcher/research staff best judgement will be used when conducting analyses and will document decisions accordingly:

* Clients who do not have memory loss
* Caregivers who do not indicate presence of memory loss for their care recipient.

In addition, any client, caregiver, and volunteer can choose to not complete surveys, so we would not have survey data from those individuals, and may continue with routine attempts at surveying at the next data collection time-point. Missing surveys may be considered during analysis.

Please note: Due to the eligibility criteria for volunteers and clients in the LSS-MN program, we do not anticipate any data for those under 18 years of age. Although the real-world, pragmatic design will allow us to include caregivers under the age of 21), it is important to note that LSS-MN's most recent data on caregivers participating in their volunteer programs indicate none under the age of 21",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05550727,NCT05550727,Unknown,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,2022-09-23,"Memory Loss, Alzheimer Disease, Dementia",PorchLight,Minneapolis - United States,2026-06-30,2022-09-22,2024-11-18,INTERVENTIONAL,NA

"Inclusion Criteria:

* Age 70-84 years. Individuals aged 70-84 at the time of randomization are eligible for participation. This age range will allow recruitment of participants who are at risk for cognitive decline but who may also be expected to survive for the duration of the trial. This age range is estimated to allow for potential participation of 61% of participants currently enrolled in the ARIC study.
* Community-dwelling.
* Fluent English-speaker.

Participants must have adult-onset hearing impairment with a four-frequency pure tone average (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) in the better-hearing ear of ≥ 30 decibels (dB) and \<70 dB. This level of hearing impairment is the level at which individuals would be most likely to benefit from the use of conventional amplification devices such as hearing aids.
* Word Recognition in Quiet score ≥60% in the better ear. A word recognition in quiet score \<60% suggests hearing impairment that is too severe to benefit from conventional amplification devices such as hearing aids.
* Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥ 23 for individuals with high-school degree or less; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≥ 25 for individuals with some college or more; Participants must be at risk for cognitive decline in the range quantified well by neurocognitive testing, and so must be free from more substantial cognitive impairment at baseline.
* Willingness to participate be randomized and adhere to the protocol.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Self-reported disability in ≥ 2 or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
* Any self-reported hearing aid use in the past year. Trial participants will be randomized to hearing intervention or successful aging intervention and, therefore, participants cannot be receiving treatment for their hearing loss already.
* ARIC participants only: Diagnosis of adjudicated dementia based on a previous ARIC visit or participant required a proxy to assist with completing informed consent and responding to questions at ARIC Visit 6 or 7.
* Vision impairment (worse than 20/63 on MNREAD Acuity Chart). Participants who cannot see (with correction) well enough to complete the neurocognitive assessment are excluded.
* Medical contraindication to use of hearing aids (e.g., draining ear). Because hearing aids will be the primary device used in the hearing intervention, participants with medical contraindications to hearing aid use are excluded.
* Permanent conductive hearing impairment as determined by a difference in air audiometry and bone audiometry (""air-bone gap"") greater than 15 dB in 2 or more contiguous frequencies in both ears. Because the impact of a conductive (versus a sensorineural) hearing loss on cognitive functioning may potentially differ and programming for hearing aids differs for conductive hearing loss, participants with permanent conductive hearing loss are excluded from the trial.

1. Males and females who are \>=15 years of age. There is no strict age cutoff at the upper limit of inclusion, however subjects may meet the exclusion criteria based on medical contraindications to deep brain stimulation surgery (Points 3. and 6. under the Exclusion Criteria). For subjects in the age range of 15-24 years, an additional Ethics Committee consultation will be obtained prior to offering the subject the required screening visit. This is based on the revised screening criteria now proposed by Shrock, Mink, et al. on studies investigating DBS in TS. Additionally, for subjects in the age range of 15-20, a caregiver will be required to be present for all study visits.
2. Subject has a diagnosis of TS as determined by a review of medical records, discussion with referring psychiatrist as well as the DSM-IV criteria and videotaped assessment. This will include an assessment to determine the presence of psychogenic tics, embellishment, factitious symptoms, personality disorders and malingering.
3. Subject determined to be treatment-resistant for at least one year prior to the Screening Visit as demonstrated by clinical evidence (determined by review of medical records and discussion with referring psychiatrist or neurologist) of persistent functionally impairing tics that have not responded to treatment with a minimum of three adequate regimens of medication including two failed trials of at least one typical neuroleptic and one atypical neuroleptic medication, along with one failed trial of a first tier medication as defined as follows:

   1. Adequate trials of one non-neuroleptic medication including drugs from the following (first tier) list: clonidine, guanfacine, topiramate, baclofen, levetiracetam, and clonazepam. Trial failure is defined as demonstrated lack of efficacy or severe side effects.
   2. Two adequate trials of at least one typical neuroleptic medication (pimozide, fluphenazine, haloperidol) and at least one atypical neuroleptic (risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine). Trial failure is defined as demonstrated lack of efficacy or severe side effects.
4. A mandatory trial of behavioral interventions in an attempt to reduce the severity of the tics or comorbid symptoms must also be completed by the subject before offering participation in this trial. This may include habit reversal therapies, stress reduction therapies, or other behavioral therapies under investigation for tic suppression.
5. Subject has both significant vocal and motor tics with a tic subscale score of at least 35 on the YGTSS (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) at all three Baseline Visits prior to undergoing surgery. For subjects with predominantly vocal tics (and minimal motor) causing significant problems this score requirement will be reduced to 18, similarly for subjects with predominantly motor tics (and minimal vocal) causing significant problems the required score will be 18. A portion of the study team, including the surgeon and two neurologists, will determine by consensus which category the subject falls into and whether the tics are a significant problem.
6. All other aspects of the subject's care must be optimized during the preceding 6 months before admission to the study. This includes treatment for comorbid medical, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, it includes psychological interventions for any ongoing psychosocial problems the subject may have during the preceding 6 months before study admission.

8. Subject has either a current or past history of suicidal plan and/or intent.
9. Subject has a tic disorder or other movement disorder attributable to another medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder other than Tourette Syndrome.
10. Subject has a drug-induced tic disorder.
11. Subject has significant psychosocial factors that might increase the risk of the DBS procedure or complicate recovery and outcome assessments. (Examples include - history of noncompliance with previous medical and psychosocial treatments, multiple failed medication treatments of inadequate dose or duration, a history of multiple other surgical procedures with poor outcome, unexplained medical history gaps, or pending lawsuits or other legal action.)
12. Subject has metal in the head or any other type of implanted stimulator (i.e. cardiac pacemaker, deep brain stimulator for a different disease, spinal cord stimulator, cochlear implant, vagus nerve stimulator, etc.).

"As the risk of HCC is significant in those with cirrhosis regardless of age, gender, or race, we will include adult patients with cirrhosis of all ages (\> 21 years old), both sexes, and all races/ethnicities who speak English or Spanish.

Our study leverages Parkland's electronic medical record (EMR) and uses a novel EMR-enabled case-finding algorithm to identify patients with known cirrhosis, using ICD-9 codes, as well as those with unrecognized but suspected cirrhosis, using a set of laboratory data.

Patients with ICD-9 codes for cirrhosis or cirrhosis complication will be eligible for study enrollment if they meet the following criteria:

* One or more encounter with ICD-9 codes 456.0, 456.1, 456.2, 456.21, 567.23, 572.2, 572.3, and 572.4; OR,

Inclusion of vulnerable participants:

Adult Participants who Lack Capacity to Consent: Participants who temporarily or permanently lose the capacity to provide consent after initially enrolling in the HANDLS study may continue to participate in follow up visits if they have an executed DPA for research in their study record or are able to provide a copy of a DPA for research executed outside of the study. Procedures for including participants who are decisionally impaired, including assessing capacity to consent and execution of the DPA will follow guidelines set forth in the NIH policy 3014-403 Research Involving Adults Who Lack Decision-making Capacity to Consent to Research Participation and recommendations in the National Institute of Mental Health Human Subjects Research Protections Toolkit.

It is expected over the course of the study that some participants will experience cognitive decline. It will be important to continue to include all participants in the study for as long as is practical because we are studying lifetime trajectories of health and require an unbiased sample to draw reasonable conclusions. Participants are invited to complete a Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) for Research at each study visit. Prior to each follow-up examination visit, assessment of capacity to consent will be (1) initiated at the time of appointment setting (2) reassessed at the pre-visit screening, and (3) final determination at the time of consent. If at any time during the pre-visit activities a participant s capacity to consent is questioned, the Squires Capacity Assessment will be administered, and the study clinician will make the final assessment about whether to initiate consent by using the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR).",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01323322,NCT01323322,Unknown,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,2009-07-01,"Diabetes, Cerebrovascular Disease, Age-Associated Decline, Cardiovascular Disease",No interventions listed,Baltimore - United States,Unknown Date,2011-03-25,2025-01-01,OBSERVATIONAL,Not Available

Cardiovascular screening:

There will be at least four blood pressure assessment occasions over at least two separate days. Within a day, assessment occasions will be separated by at least 15 minutes. Each assessment occasion will involve two or more blood pressure readings. To qualify for the study, the mean blood pressure (mm Hg) of the four or more assessment occasions will not exceed 140 systolic and 90 diastolic.

Blood pressure will be taken while subjects are at rest and have been seated or supine for at least 5 minutes. As recommended by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, these assessments will involve the average of 2 or more readings separated by two minutes. If the first 2 readings differ by more than 5 mm Hg, additional readings will be obtained and averaged. On one or more of the blood pressure measurement occasions, the volunteer will be acclimated to the automated blood pressure monitoring equipment by repeatedly taking blood pressure (at least 3 readings) with the device. Because it has been our experience that time-to-time blood pressure readings with the automated equipment can be variable due to measurement artifact, any reading that initially exceeds our threshold value will be reassessed twice within 4 minutes to assure accuracy.",https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00465595,NCT00465595,Unknown,COMPLETED,2007-04,"Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Cancer",psilocybin,Baltimore - United States,2014-12,2007-04-25,2018-07-19,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2

"Inclusion Criteria

* Children who have not been treated with long-term targeted PAH drug therapy, which include calcium channel blockers (CCB); prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) or PDE-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) (note that agents used for vasoreactivity testing during cardiac catheterization, or for acute periprocedural stabilization will be discontinued prior to study enrollment these include inhaled nitric oxide and/or prostacyclin analogs) a. Children who have been receiving subtherapeutic dosing of sildenafil (and no other standing therapy) for less than 2 weeks at the time of their referral for evaluation at a PH Center, may be included after a washout period of two days. Subtherapeutic is defined as dosage less than those shown in Section 6.1.2 sildenafil dosing chart. If, prior to the initial diagnostic cardiac catheterization, the independent clinical practitioner is planning to stop low dose sildenafil that is judged to not have therapeutic impact on hemodynamics by echocardiography, one may include this candidate for enrollment. These children will be followed closely during the washout period for clinical findings of cardiorespiratory changes, and with echocardiography and NT-proBNP measurements. Abnormal findings on these screening tests will prompt consideration of acute initiation of inhaled nitric oxide therapy. Therapy for pulmonary hypertension as determined by randomization for the study, may be started immediately after the two day washout period.
* Diagnosis of PAH by cardiology diagnostics

  1. Diagnosis by cardiac catheterization with in the previous six months: PAH is defined as the presence of mean pulmonary artery pressure \> 25mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (or left atrial or left ventricular end diastolic pressure) ≤ 15 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) \> 3 Woods Units
  2. For infants less than one year of age for whom cardiac catheterization is not considered as part of the clinical team's recommended approach, enrollment will be possible without catheterization if the following four criteria are met:

  i. Two separate echocardiograms clearly demonstrate pulmonary hypertension by at least three of the following metrics:
  * Elevated MPA pressure (early diastolic PR peak gradient \>20 mmHg)
  * Right ventricular hypertrophy (qualitative as mild to severe)
  * Right atrial enlargement (scales for age will be provided)
  * Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (\>35mmHg) on at least two at least two reliable spectral Doppler envelopes during the echocardiogram and in the setting of normal for age documented systolic blood pressure at least two reliable spectral Doppler envelopes during the echocardiogram.
  * Flattening or (R to L) bowing of the interventricular septum (qualitative or by elevated eccentricity index)
  * Diminished RV function (RV fractional area change \<35%) and/or TAPSE below published normal range for age and weight.

ii. There is no clinical or imaging evidence of left heart dysfunction; iii. Pulmonary venous stenosis and atresia are ruled out by CT angiography or MRI unless all four pulmonary veins are unequivocally normal on the two separate echocardiograms; iv. There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunting across an unrestricted systemic to pulmonary shunt (this is unlikely to be a concern for PFO, small ASD, or restrictive PDA or VSD).
